# Book Recommendation and Club System

## Project Overview
This project aims to develop a **book recommendation system** that dynamically matches users with similar reading preferences and groups them into **book clubs**. The system will provide personalized book recommendations and allow users to join clubs based on their shared interests.

---

## Phases of the Project

### Phase 1: Define Project Scope and Goals
**Objective:**  
Create a system that recommends books to users and dynamically matches readers with similar preferences into book clubs.

**Key Features:**
- Recommend books based on user preferences or reading history.
- Group users into clubs based on shared interests.

**Output:**  
A working system with a recommendation engine and dynamic clustering for book clubs.

### Phase 2: Data Collection and Preparation

**Book Data Collection:**
- Use APIs like Google Books API or Open Library API.
- Collect book metadata (title, genre, author, summary, rating).

**Simulate User Data:**
- Simulate profiles with preferences like genres, favorite books, and ratings.
  Example features: user_id, liked_books, ratings, preferred_genres.

**Data Cleaning:**
- Remove duplicates, missing values, or irrelevant fields.
- Convert text fields (e.g., genres) into a usable format (e.g., one-hot encoding).

**Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):**
- Visualize user preferences (e.g., most liked genres).
- Explore book popularity trends and similarities between users.

---

### Phase 3: Recommendation Engine Development

**Collaborative Filtering:**
- **Objective:** Recommend books based on what similar users liked.
- Use models like KNN or matrix factorization (e.g., SVD).

**Content-Based Filtering:**
- **Objective:** Recommend books similar to ones the user already liked.
- Vectorize book metadata using TF-IDF or Word2Vec for similarity analysis.

**Hybrid Model:**
- Combine collaborative and content-based filtering for better results.

**Evaluation:**
- **Metrics:** Precision, Recall, F1-score, or RMSE (for rating predictions).
- Use cross-validation to test model robustness.

---

### Phase 4: Dynamic Book Club Creation

**Clustering Users:**
- Use clustering algorithms like K-Means or DBSCAN.
- Cluster users based on preferences, ratings, or reading history.

**Club Formation Logic:**
- Define thresholds for cluster size (e.g., 5â€“10 users per club).
- Ensure users in a cluster share significant overlap in preferences.

**Dynamic Updates:**
- Allow clubs to evolve as user preferences change.
- Use incremental clustering or periodic re-clustering.

---

### Phase 5: User Interface Development

**Interface for Users:**
- Input preferences (e.g., favorite genres, liked books).
- View personalized book recommendations and suggested book clubs.

**Interface for Admins:**
- View and manage book clubs.
- Add new books or genres to the system.

---

### Phase 6: Deployment and Testing

**Backend Development:**
- Build APIs to serve recommendations and cluster data.
- Frameworks: Flask or FastAPI.

**Frontend Development:**
- Use a basic web or mobile app to interact with the system.

**Testing:**
- Unit tests for recommendation accuracy.
- Integration tests for the full system.

---

### Phase 7: Enhancements

**User Feedback Integration:**
- Add feedback mechanisms for users to rate recommendations and clubs.
- Retrain models periodically using this data.

**Advanced Features:**
- Sentiment analysis on book reviews for nuanced recommendations.
- Social features: Enable users to chat within book clubs.
