# Machine Learning and Data Science Journey ðŸš€

Welcome to my repository! This is where I document my learning progress, share projects, and explore the fascinating world of **Machine Learning** and **Data Science**. 

## About Me
Iâ€™m a passionate learner with a background in **Chemical Engineering**, diving into the limitless possibilities of data and machine learning. My journey is driven by curiosity, a love for problem-solving, and the desire to create unique and impactful projects.

## What You'll Find Here
This repository is a growing collection of my:
- **Learning Progress**: Concepts and techniques Iâ€™ve explored and practiced.
- **Projects**: Hands-on implementations of algorithms, models, and data science applications.
- **Creative Experiments**: Unique project ideas that go beyond the conventional, aiming to stand out and make a difference

## Current Projects
I am currently focusing on:
1. **Dynamic Book Club Creator**: A machine learning model to group people based on reading preferences and suggest books dynamically.
2. **AI Wedding Planner**: A smart planner to help organize weddings by understanding user preferences and suggesting the best options for venues, themes, and more

## Completed Topics
- **Regression**: Including polynomial regression and understanding data transformations.
- **Classification**: Currently learning **K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)** and other classification techniques.

## Upcoming Plans
I aim to:
- Continue mastering machine learning algorithms.
- Work on **recommendation systems**, starting with a shopping app model that learns purchase patterns.
- Explore emotional AI and its applications, such as music playlist generation.
